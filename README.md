## Abstract
For this project, agiven a file containing 39 different images of faces with 65 lighting sceese. Each of these image have been downsampled to 32 by 32 pixels along with being converted to grayscales. Using these images, the goal of this project is to apply different kinds of linear equations to gather data for correlation matrixes. 
## Introduction and Overview
The main goal of this project is to understand the data set and its structure as well as to practice linear algebra to understand its correlation to machine learning. To obtain this goal, the project contains seven different task

### Task A
Compute a 100 by 100 correlation matrix by computing the dot projects for the first 100 images within the matrix X. 

### Task B
Using the correlation matrix computedd in the previous task, determine the two most correlated and the the two most uncorrelated image. 

### Task C

repeating the process from task (a), but instead of computing a 100x100 correlation matrix,  compute a 10x10 correlation matrix between images. Compute the dot product (correlation) between the images with indices [1, 313, 512, 5, 2400, 113, 1024, 87, 314, 2005]. Then plot the correlation matrix between these images. 

### Task D

creating a matrix Y by multiplying X with its transpose (XX^T). We will then find the first six eigenvectors with the largest magnitude eigenvalue of this matrix Y. This task will help us identify the most important directions in the data that capture the most variation.

### Task E

### Task F
